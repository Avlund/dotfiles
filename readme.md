# Brian's Dotfiles

## What Is This?

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my Mac. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. Everything which is needed to install my preffered setup of OS X is detailed in this readme. Feel free to explore, learn and copy parts for your own dotfiles. Enjoy! :smile:

## A Fresh OS X Setup

1. Update OS X to the latest version with the App Store
1. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement

1. Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to `600`
1. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`

1. Make sure Dropbox is set up and synced
1. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

## Your Own Dotfiles

If you want to start your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.osx`](./.osx) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.osx) and [Kevin Suttle's OSX Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/OSXDefaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine. Use [their search page](https://caskroom.github.io/search) to check if the app you want to install is available.


When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install and backup your settings with the command below. Your settings will be synced to your Dropbox so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different folder or different medium than Dropbox, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup#supported-storages).

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```


Enjoy your own Dotfiles!

## Thanks To...

I first got the idea for starting this project by visiting the [Github does dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) project. Both [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) were great sources of inspiration. [Sourabh Bajaj](https://twitter.com/sb2nov/)'s [Mac OS X Setup Guide](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/) proved to be invaluable. Thanks to [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) for [his awesome Zsh theme](https://github.com/taylorotwell/shell)! And lastly, I'd like to thank [Maxime Fabre](https://twitter.com/anahkiasen) for [his excellent presentation on Homebrew](https://speakerdeck.com/anahkiasen/a-storm-homebrewin) which made me migrate a lot to a `Brewfile` and [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup).

In general, I'd like to thank every single one who open-sources their dotfiles for their effort to contribute something to the open-source community. Your work means the world! :earth_africa: :heart:
